# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, make sure that you follow the processes below.

## Issues

1. Issue title starts with a capital letter and ends without punctuation.
1. Title must be brief, clear and relevant to its internals.
1. Use simple present tense if there is a verb.
1. Your issue bodymust follow the structure provided in the issue template.

**Examples issue titles:**

✗ ~~**Updating the use case diagram**~~
✓ **Update the use case diagram**

✗ ~~**Adding Login Endpoint For The Backend**~~
✓ **Add login endpoint for the backend**

## Branches

1. There will be branch directories for the subprojects like ```backend/``` or ```android/``` to organize the branches.
1. For every issue, you should create a branch (which must be derived from the ```master```) named ```{branch-directory}/issue-{number}```. You can commit your changes to these branches.
1. Branch directory names must be lowercase.

**Example branch names:**

✗ ~~```Backend/Issue-132```~~
✓ ```backend/issue-132```

✗ ~~```frontend/issue148```~~
✓ ```frontend/issue-148```

## Commits

1. Make sure you don't change a lot of things in one commmit. It is hard for your team members to review them.
1. If the commit is about adding a button to frontend, do not change a lot of files in order to correct indentations or whitespaces. Writing clean code is also important but you should do it in another commit, not in a commit for adding button.
1. Make sure your commit name is relevant to what you have changed.
1. Commit titles must be in lowercase.
1. If there is a verb in your commit title, place them in the beginning of the sentence and use simple present tense.
1. Don't forget to include commit details if necessary. Sentences in commit details must begin with a capital letter and end with a punctuation. Insert a new line for separate sentences in a commit detail.

**Example commit titles:**

✗ ~~Add login button~~
✓ add login button

✗ ~~deleting unnecessary lines~~
✓ delete unnecessary lines

✗ ~~Files are updated.~~
✓ update files

**Example commit descriptions:**

✗ ~~button in the login page is centered. equipment details are added to the portfolio page~~
✓ Button in the login page is centered.\nEquipment details are added to the portfolio page.

## Pull Requests

1. Important to note that a change mustn't be committed directly to the ```master``` branch. You must use pull requests to do that.
1. If your branch is ready to be merged to the ```master```, then create a pull request.
1. Every team member working in the same brach directory (e.g. everyone in the ```backend/```) must review the pull request and approve it in order for the PR to be merged.
1. If a member give a feedback to change something in the code, the changes must be made and make that person approve the new changes. If everyone approves, then the PR can be merged.
1. Your PR structure must follow the guidelines provided in the pull request template.
